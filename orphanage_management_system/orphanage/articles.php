	<h3>An orphanage is a place where children without parents are cared for and housed</h3>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many orphans are actually not ‘orphans’ in the literal sense - they simply have been put into foster care by families who find it hard to take care of them. Often, it is due to an absent or negligent father, and a working mother and a mother who must work and doesn't have the time to provide care. These parents consider an orphanage’s care infrastructure to be better than their own home and care. This is because they are unaware of the true conditions of a children’s orphanage.<br>
    



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the heart of every child is a hunger for home. Not just for food and a place to sleep, but for safety and community. We are much more than a home for unwanted Indian orphans.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are a family, where God’s love guides us all as we grow and expand year after year. Not just an orphanage, we are a nearly self-sustaining organization; a working farm, a vibrant school, receiving no government assistance of any kind. Take a look around and if you have any questions just get in contact with us.
