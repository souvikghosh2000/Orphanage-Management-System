# Orphanage-Management-System
As part of my Web Development project, we made an orphanage management system using HTML,CSS, JS and SQL. We have also used PHP for connecting backend with frontend.
People can choose any of the orphanage from where they want to adopt the baby, the admin can check for all the updates happening in background.
